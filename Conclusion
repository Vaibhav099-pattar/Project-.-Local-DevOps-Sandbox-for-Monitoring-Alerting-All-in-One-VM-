This project successfully demonstrates the setup of a fully functional local DevOps sandbox that integrates essential 
monitoring and alerting tools using open-source technologies. By deploying Prometheus, Grafana, Node Exporter,
and Alertmanager on a single Red Hat-based virtual machine, we created a simulated production-like environment 
suitable for learning, testing, and practicing DevOps monitoring workflows.

The sandbox allows users to visualize real-time system metrics, create custom dashboards, and
configure alerting rules that notify users of critical events such as high CPU usage or low disk space.
All configurations and services are automated using shell scripts, ensuring that the environment is reproducible
and easy to set up for others.

This project not only enhances understanding of key observability tools but also provides hands-on
experience in setting up and managing an end-to-end monitoring pipeline. It serves as a valuable resource
for students, DevOps learners, and professionals aiming to strengthen their skills in system monitoring, alerting, 
and infrastructure visibility.
