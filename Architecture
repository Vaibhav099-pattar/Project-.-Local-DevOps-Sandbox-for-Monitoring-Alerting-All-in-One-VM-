The architecture of this sandbox environment is designed to emulate a basic observability stack typically used in 
real-world DevOps infrastructures. All components are deployed on a single Red Hat-based
VM hosted on VMware, ensuring ease of setup and isolation.

Components Overview:
Node Exporter

Installed on the same VM to expose system-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk, etc.) to Prometheus.

Runs as a background service on port 9100.

Prometheus:
The core monitoring tool that scrapes metrics from Node Exporter and stores them in a time-series database.
Runs on port 9090 and is configured to collect metrics at defined intervals.
Also responsible for evaluating alerting rules and pushing alerts to Alertmanager.

Alertmanager:
Listens for alerts from Prometheus and manages alert routing, grouping, silencing, and notification.
Runs on port 9093.

Grafana:
Connects to Prometheus as a data source and provides rich visual dashboards.
Offers predefined templates like the Node Exporter Full dashboard for easy insights.
Runs on port 3000.
