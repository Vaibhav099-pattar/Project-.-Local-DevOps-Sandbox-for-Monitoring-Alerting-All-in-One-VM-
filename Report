 Abstract:

This project focuses on building a self-contained DevOps sandbox environment for learning and testing monitoring 
and alerting tools using a single virtual machine. The VM, built on Red Hat Linux and hosted on VMware, comes pre-configured 
with Prometheus, Node Exporter, Grafana, and Alertmanager. These tools collectively allow users to collect system metrics, visualize 
them through dashboards, and receive alerts based on predefined rules. The sandbox serves as a local, production-like setup for beginners
and professionals looking to practice observability and system monitoring 
without requiring access to cloud infrastructure.

Introduction:
Monitoring and alerting are key components of any DevOps strategy, ensuring system reliability, performance, and timely
incident response. However, learning these tools often requires access to cloud or distributed environments. This project solves that 
by providing a local, all-in-one VM with the essential monitoring stack installed and configured. Users can simulate CPU/disk/memory alerts, create dashboards, and understand how alerts flow
through the monitoring pipeline.

Tools Used:
VMware Workstation/Player – Local VM hosting

Red Hat Linux – OS for running the stack

Prometheus – Metrics collection and alerting rules

Node Exporter – System metrics exporter

Grafana – Dashboard and visualization

Alertmanager – Alert notification and routing

Shell Scripts – Automated setup of all components


Architecture:

[Node Exporter]  --->  [Prometheus]  --->  [Alertmanager]
        |                    |
        |                    |
        +--->  [Grafana] <---+
Prometheus scrapes Node Exporter on port 9100

Alertmanager listens on 9093 for alerts from Prometheus

Grafana queries Prometheus at 9090 and shows data on dashboards

All tools run locally on a Red Hat VM via systemd services

Steps Involved:
VM Setup: Create a Red Hat VM on VMware and update the OS

Install Node Exporter: Expose system metrics on port 9100

Install Prometheus: Configure to scrape Node Exporter and set alerting rules

Install Alertmanager: Set up alert routing with default receiver

Install Grafana: Add Prometheus as a data source and import dashboards

Test Setup: Simulate CPU load using stress and observe alerts.


Conclusion:
This project delivers a complete and portable DevOps monitoring sandbox ideal for self-learning and training. 
By integrating Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, and Node Exporter into one VM, users can gain hands-on experience 
with real-world observability tools in a safe local environment. With automation scripts and pre-configured alerts, 
he sandbox is ready-to-use and 
easily extendable for future experimentation or classroom use.
