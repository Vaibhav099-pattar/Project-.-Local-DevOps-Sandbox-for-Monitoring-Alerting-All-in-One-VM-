Title: Local DevOps Sandbox for Monitoring & Alerting (All-in-One VM)

This project aims to build a self-contained DevOps sandbox environment designed for training, testing, and experimentation with modern 
monitoring and alerting tools. The environment is provisioned using a single virtual machine (VM) running 
on VMware with Red Hat OS, and automates the installation and configuration of a complete monitoring stack
including Prometheus, Node Exporter, Grafana, and Alertmanager.

The VM simulates real-world infrastructure and enables users to monitor system metrics, 
visualize data on interactive dashboards, and receive alerts on predefined thresholds such as CPU,
memory, and disk usage. Configuration is automated through shell scripts, ensuring repeatability and ease of use.
Grafana dashboards and Prometheus alerting rules are preconfigured to help users quickly understand
how observability works in practice.

The sandbox provides a safe and isolated setup for DevOps learners to explore open-source tools, test alert configurations,
and analyze system performance metricsâ€”making it a powerful resource for skill development without needing access to 
cloud infrastructure.
